# A5: Project Proposal


#### Motivation and problem statement: 
I am attempting to look at the investments of individuals in the 50+ age group.  There are strict investment rules for individuals in this age category.   Advisors acting as a fiduciary must ensure that all investments meet strict suitibility guidelines.   As such, advisors are unable to recommend many green investments as the timeline for returns may be longer than traditional blue chip stocks.

#### Data selected for analysis: 
What dataset do you plan to use, and why? 
FINRA - National Financial Capability Study


Summarize what is represented in the dataset
.The overarching research objectives of the National Financial Capability Study were to benchmark key indicators of financial capability and evaluate how these indicators vary with underlying demographic, behavioral, attitudinal and financial literacy characteristics. The 2012 Study updated key measures from the 2009 Study and deepened the exploration of topics that are highly relevant today. The 2015 and 2018 Studies continue in this vein.
Approximately 30 percent of respondents to the 2018 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS) State-by-State Survey reported investing outside of tax-advantaged retirement accounts such as an IRA or 401(k). To obtain deeper insight on investing decisions, the FINRA Foundation commissioned a separate follow-up survey of investors as part of the 2018 NFCS. The Investor Survey explores topics such as relationships with investment brokers and advisors, understanding and perceptions of fees charged for investment services, usage of investment information sources, attitudes towards investing in general, and investor knowledge.
