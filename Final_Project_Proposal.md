One or more paragraphs of text that answers the questions:
Why are you planning to do this analysis? 
Why is it potentially interesting and useful, from a scientific, practical, and/or human-centered perspective? 
What do you hope to learn? 
Note that you only need to describe your overall research goal at this stage; specific hypotheses or research questions arenâ€™t necessary in the project preliminary proposal.

#### Data selected for analysis: 
What dataset do you plan to use, and why? 
Summarize what is represented in the dataset
Link to the dataset (it must be publicly available)
