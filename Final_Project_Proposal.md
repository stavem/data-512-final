# A5: Project Proposal


### Motivation and problem statement
According the the SEC, Americans over the age of 50 hold nearly 77% of financial assets in the United States.   This means that this particular demographic group holds a tremendous amount of power within the financial system.  Given that there are large differences in the values of this generation vs younger generations, I would like to examine the ways in which this affects investment behavior across these groups.

### Data selected for analysis
For my analysis, I will use a longitudinal survey conducted by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).  This study is called the FINRA - National Financial Capability Study.  This survey benchmarks key indicators of financial capability and evaluates how these indicators vary with demographic, behavioral, attitudinal, and financial literacy characteristics and tracks these changes over time.   I have data available from the years 2009, 2012, 2015, and 2018.

Additionally, roughly 30% of the respondents in the 2018 study reported holding investments in accounts such as an IRA or 401(k).  For these respondents an additional follow-up survey was conducted to explore topics such as relationships with investment brokers and advisors, understanding and perceptions of fees charged for investment services, usage of investment information sources, attitudes towards investing in general, and investor knowledge.

### Unknowns and dependencies 

It is possible that there is not enough data available within each age group to make statistically significant inferences regarding the general behavior and attitudes of each group.  Addtionally, I do not have access to the invidiual investments (stocks, mutual funds) that are held by the survey respondents.  This may limit my ability to truly understand their behavior and will instead need to focus on their attitudes/feelings.
  
### Research questions and/or hypotheses

#### Research Question

Do the attitudes of investors above the age of 50 affect the types of investments they hold?  Given that this age group holds 77% of all assets, do these attitudes move the markets in a direction that enourages younger investors to participate?

#### Hypothesis

Since the values of young investors differ from those in the above 50 age group, the general shape of the investment landscape is not inline with their core values, and this disincentivizes them from participating in the market.
