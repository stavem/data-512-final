    "#### Descrption\n",
    "The primary dataset used to address these questions is the _2018 National Financial Capability Study (NFCS)_, funded by the FINRA Investor Education Foundation.  The NFCS is a longitudinal survey conducted across the United States every three years.   The goal of the survey is to benchmark key indicators of financial capability in U.S. households and evaluate how these indictors vary by regions, attitudes, and demographics.  While this is a longitudinal survey that has been conducted every three years since 2009, my analysis focuses exclusively on the 2018 dataset.  While the FINRA Investor Education Foundation publishes its own findings on this data, it has made the datasets, questionaires, and documents available to outside researchers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dimensions\n",
    "The 2018 NFCS contains responses from roughly 27,000 households across all 50 states.  Each respondent provided answers to 127 different questions.   All responses have been numericall encoded into a single .csv file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Access\n",
    "\n",
    "The 2018 NFCS dataset is freely available online and is subject to FINRA's [terms of use](https://www.usfinancialcapability.org/terms.php).  Full details and descrptions can be found on the on the [Data and Downloads](https://www.usfinancialcapability.org/downloads.php) page of the US Financial Capability website.  The primrary dataset used in this exploration is titled, _2018 State-by-State Survey â€” Respondent-Level Data, Comma delimited Excel file (.csv)_ and it may be downloaded in a .zip file directly from FINRA's website using [this link](https://www.usfinancialcapability.org/downloads/NFCS_2018_State_by_State_Data_Excel.zip).  This project already contains the full 2018 NFCS dataset, which can be viewed directly here: [\\\"NFCS 2018 State Data 190603.csv\\\"](raw_data/NFCS%202018%20State%20Data%20190603.csv). "
